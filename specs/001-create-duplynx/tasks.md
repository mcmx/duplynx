## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2**: Foundational work depends on setup.
- **Phase 2 ‚Üí Phases 3-6**: All user stories require Ent schemas, secure ingestion, routing, and CI tooling.
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Enables tenant context and seeding‚ÄîMVP checkpoint.
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Depends on US1 data structures but can progress in parallel once foundational services exist.
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Builds on duplicate group representations from US2 and ingestion logging from Phase 2.
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: Builds on tenancy infrastructure from US1 and repository layers from US2/US3.
- **Phase 7**: Runs after desired user stories complete; captures documentation and performance compliance.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (deliver US1)
1. Complete Phases 1-2 to establish infrastructure.
2. Execute Phase 3 (US1) to unlock tenant selection MVP.
3. Validate onboarding via contract + e2e tests before proceeding.

### Incremental Delivery
1. After MVP, deliver Phase 4 (US2) to expose the scan board.
2. Layer Phase 5 (US3) for keeper actions and auditing.
3. Finish with Phase 6 (US4) to harden tenant boundaries.
4. Close with Phase 7 polish for documentation, accessibility, and performance signage.

### Parallel Team Strategy
1. Run Phases 1-2 with shared effort.
2. Once Phase 2 completes:
   - Developer A: Phase 3 (US1)
   - Developer B: Phase 4 (US2)
   - Developer C: Phase 5 (US3)
   - Developer D: Phase 6 (US4)
3. Sync on Phase 7 for cross-cutting polish and release prep.

## Task Counts & Coverage

- **Total tasks**: 71
- **Per user story**:
  - US1: 15 tasks
  - US2: 9 tasks
  - US3: 12 tasks
  - US4: 6 tasks
- **Parallel opportunities**: Tests and component work within each story marked `[P]` can proceed concurrently once prerequisites land.
- **Independent test criteria**:
  - US1: Tenant and machine selection completes within three clicks and loads seeded scans.
  - US2: Scan board lanes render with correct counts and card expansion details.
  - US3: Keeper assignment succeeds, actions log audits, and statuses remain manual.
  - US4: Cross-tenant requests fail with scoped warnings and 404s.
- **Suggested MVP scope**: Deliver through Phase 3 (US1) to demonstrate tenant/machine onboarding end-to-end.

All tasks follow the required checklist format with sequential IDs, `[P]` markers where applicable, and explicit file paths.
